## About the Project

In the restaurant industry, an empty table is lost revenue that can never be recovered. **Sponti** provides an infrastructure where owners can launch flash deals in seconds. Customers receive push notifications and see live pins on a map, encouraging them to visit *now*.

The platform uses Gemini API to help owners craft the perfect deal based on their current situation (e.g., "It's raining and I have 20 portions of soup left").

##  Key Features

###  For Customers

- ** Digital Wallet & Favorites:** Securely manage payment methods and keep track of top-rated local spots.

###  For Restaurant Owners
- ** Performance Dashboard:** Real-time tracking of redemptions, revenue analytics, and weekly activity charts via Recharts.
