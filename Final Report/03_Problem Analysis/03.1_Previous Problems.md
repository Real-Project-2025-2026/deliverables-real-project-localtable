## 1. Triathlon
    1. Our inital problem idea was to organize better and more structured triathlon training options in the city.
    2. The idea fell through mainly because Triathlon has a rather smal lnumber of participants, resukting in insufficient demand.
## 2. Students teaching
    1. Furthermore we adressed the issue that university sports programs are often fully booked, preventing many students from trying new sports while other alternatives are usually too expensive and inflexible 
    2. We decided against this idea because the problem is not city-specific and therefore does not represent a distinct urban challenge
## 3. Local Café recognition
    1. Another problem we examined was that many small, local cafés struggle to gain visibility because they are overshadowed by large café chains
    2. We recognized that limited visibility is not the primary challenge cafés face. Instead, they are more affected by structural issues such as high rents and staff shortages
