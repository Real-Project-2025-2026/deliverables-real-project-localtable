**1. Why is the problem a problem?**

Restaurants in urban areas experience strong demand fluctuations: they are fully booked during peak hours but have many empty tables during off-peak periods (afternoons, weekdays). This creates inefficiency and financial pressure

**2. Why? (Direct impact)**

Because guest demand follows traditional dining patterns (12–14h, 18–21h) and there is no system that encourages diners to shift their visits to other time slots

**3. Why? (Cause–effect)**

Because existing platforms (reservations, delivery services, review sites, discount apps) do not influence *when* guests come. They only support booking, discovery, or ordering, but do not manage the timing of demand

**4. Why? (Organizational hurdles)**

Restaurants that are open all day lack the tools, time, and resources to promote off-peak hours themselves. They rely on walk-ins or generic marketing, which is not time-specific and often ineffective

**5. Why? (System hurdles)**

Because the overall dining ecosystem is not built for temporal balancing:

- diners follow habitual routines
- platforms focus on peak-time convenience
- restaurants operate under rising fixed costs with no mechanism for smoothing utilization

As a result, off-peak potential remains unused while peak periods are overloaded
