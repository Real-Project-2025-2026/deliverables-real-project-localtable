Key Findings:

- **Extreme demand imbalance**
    - Urban gastronomy experiences strong peaks (12-2 PM, 6-9 PM) and extended off-peaks with little to no revenue
    - Fixed costs (staff, rent, utilities) continue throughout the day → inefficient capacity utilization
- **High economic burden**
    - Most restaurants keep staff scheduled even when there are hardly any guests
    - Off-peak times generate costs but no proportional revenue
    - This gap is a central reason for low margins in the gastronomy sector
- **Existing tools don't solve the core problem**
    - Reservation tools (OpenTable, Quandoo) → help with peak organization, not off-peak utilization
    - Delivery apps → tend to intensify peaks rather than distribute demand
    - Discount apps like NeoTaste → are not time-based, no real demand steering
- **Consumer side: Behavior is steerable but untapped**
    - People respond strongly to time-limited incentives (Happy Hours, TooGoodToGo)
    - No system exists that specifically leverages this behavioral willingness for gastronomy off-peaks
