**Strategic Gap Analysis**

Across all competitors, several core restaurant and customer needs remain unmet. These gaps create a clear opportunity for LocalTable:

**1. No Off-Peak Demand Steering**

None of the existing platforms encourage guests to visit restaurants during low-demand periods. Reservations, delivery and deal apps all operate independently of time-of-day dynamics

**2. No Capacity Optimization**

Competitors do not help restaurants distribute demand more evenly across the day. Peak times remain overloaded, while off-peak hours stay underutilized

**3. No Localized Demand Insights**

Urban dining patterns vary strongly by city and neighborhood, yet no platform offers city-specific or time-specific demand data that restaurants can act on

**4. No Dynamic, Capacity-Based Incentives**

While some apps offer discounts, none adjust incentives based on real-time or predictable occupancy levels

**⇒ Resulting Opportunity:** LocalTable addresses these gaps by offering **time-specific incentives**, **demand steering**, and **capacity-aware features**
