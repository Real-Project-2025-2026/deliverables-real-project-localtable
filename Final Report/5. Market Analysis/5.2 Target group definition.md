### **5.2.1. Restaurant Owners (Supply Side)**

**Focus:** Restaurants that are open throughout the day.

We analysed that LocalTable is particularly relevant for owners whose business model requires continuous operation, such as casual dining restaurants, bistros, and neighborhood restaurants that do not close between lunch and dinner. For them, unused afternoon hours translate directly into lost revenue and inefficient staffing.

**Persona: Julian – Full-Day Restaurant Owner**

- **Age:** 39
- **Location:** Munich, Glockenbachviertel
- **Operation:** Open all day; 7 employees
- **Goal:** Maintain steady occupancy across the day
- **Pain Points:**
    - Significant drop in demand between peak periods
    - Rising fixed costs (staff, rent, utilities) require continuous traffic
    - Difficulty planning staff when demand is concentrated in narrow time windows
- **Quote:** *“Every Friday night we’re fully booked, but on Tuesdays we barely cover costs. I need a way to balance that.”*

**Core Needs Identified:**

- Tools to bring guests during low-demand hours
- Higher predictability despite rising costs
- Solutions that work without high commissions or complex integrations

**POINT OF VIEW (POV)**

**Julian, a full-day restaurant owner, needs a way to attract guests during off-peak hours because his business model depends on steady utilization throughout the day, not just during peak times.**

### **5.2.2. Young Urban Diners (Demand Side)**

**Focus:** Price-sensitive young adults who are flexible in timing.

Interview findings indicate that younger urban consumers (students, young professionals, and 20–35-year-olds )show the highest willingness to adjust their dining times in exchange for a financial or experiential benefit. They value spontaneity and enjoy eating out frequently

**Persona: Nadine – Young Urban Foodie**

- **Age:** 27
- **Occupation:** Digital professional in Munich
- **Lifestyle:** Social, spontaneous, frequently eats out
- **Motivations:** Affordable experiences, discovering new spots, flexible timing
- **Pain Points:**
    - High prices in Munich reduce spontaneous dining
    - Popular places fully booked during peak hours
    - Limited transparency on where capacity is available sooner
- **Behavior Insight:** Young diners are willing to visit earlier (e.g., 17:00–18:00) or later than typical peak times *if the incentive feels worthwhile*.
- Quote: *“I don’t want to waste time deciding where to eat; just show me good places that have space now.”*

**Core Needs Identified:**

- Price incentives tied to flexibility
- Transparency about available tables outside peak times
- A simple way to discover restaurants they might otherwise overlook

**POINT OF VIEW (POV)**

**Nadine, a young and price-sensitive urban diner, needs a way to access less crowded restaurants at alternative times because she is frustrated with overbooked peak hours and is willing to eat earlier or later if she receives a meaningful discount.**

### 5.2.3 **Updated Demand-Side Focus: Students Living in Munich**

Following the mid-term presentation, we refined the demand-side target group based on the feedback received. While *young urban diners* remain generally relevant, the segment was considered too broad.

As a result, we narrowed the demand-side focus to **students living in Munich**. Interview feedback and our discussion highlighted that students are the most price-sensitive group and at the same time the most flexible in terms of dining time, making them particularly responsive to time-based incentives and spontaneous offers. Additionally, as students ourselves, we are able to better understand their needs. Concentrating on this clearly defined segment allows for a more targeted value proposition, sharper communication, and a more realistic go-to-market approach in the early stage.

### 5.2.4 **Updated Supply-Side Focus:**

After identifying students as the primary target group on the diner side, the focus on the restaurant side was refined accordingly. The concept therefore now prioritizes restaurants located close to universities or in student-heavy areas, where demand-side and supply-side conditions are most likely to match.

While all-day restaurants are the initial core target group, they are not the only businesses that can benefit from the concept. We focus on them first because restaurants that stay open all day are especially likely to have off-peak hours. However, Local Table can also support other restaurants that struggle with low demand at certain times or are under economic pressure, regardless of their opening hours.
