**Revenue Model** (as seen in 9.1 Business Model)

- Commission-Based Revenue Model, which is charged per completed customer visit
- Commission rate of **7%**, based on two interviews with Restaurant Owners

### 9.3.1 P&L Calculation

General Information:

- **150.000 Students** in Munich
- ~1.200 Restaurants in Munich
- out of that 70% are independent Restaurants → 940  Restaurants
- about 30% of that are open all day long → **282 Restaurants** - This is based on a calculation we did by analyzing one quarter via google maps and finding out what percentage of restaurants within that quarter are open all day; we applied our findings to the whole city since there are no direct sources stating how many restaurants are open throughout the whole day (→ see also 5.4.2 Market Size estimation)
- we expect users to visit a restaurant through our app about **once to twice** a month based on Interview findings
- The Price is equivalent to the **commission per booking we receive**; we calculated an average of 20€ per Restaurant visit, about 20% price reduction (Deal on the App) and a 7% commission resulting in a **price of €1,12** (→ of course this can vary, but in order to provide financial estimation I used this as our base “price”)
- Nr. of guests referred is always the student amount times 1,5 (since they´ll visit once or twice a month)

1. **Realistic user adaption rates:**
    
    **First Year**
    
    **Months 1-3 (0.25-0.55%)**
    
    **Platform reach: 375 - 825 students** 
    
    - 20-30 restaurants live
    - Launch in 1-2 student districts (e.g. Maxvorstadt, Univiertel)
    
    **Months 4-6 (0.7-1.2%)**
    
    **Platform reach:** **1,050 - 1,800 students**
    
    - 40-60 restaurants live
    - Expansion to 3-4 districts
    
    **Months 7-9 (1.47-1.97%)**
    
    **Platform reach: 2,200 - 2,950 students**
    
    - 70-90 restaurants live
    - higher Marketing efforts during the summer season → more free time for students
    
    **Months 10-12 (2-2.13%)**
    
    **Platform reach: 3,000 - 3,200 students**
    
    - ~100 restaurants live
    - expect slower app registration since university starts again → during winter we usually have less time to go out
    
    **Second Year**
    
    → we expect our app to grow slowly but steadily in a year round adoption rate 2.27-3.33%, reaching 3.400 users in January and ending up with 5.000 users in December 
    

1. **Marketing**
    - Months 1-3: €1,000-1,300/month for a strong market penetration
    - Months 4-7: **€800-€900/month** for student outreach and digital ads
    - Months 10-12: **€800/month** keeping up local partnerships and ads

1. **Product & Tech**
    - **~€100/month** for servers and outsourced maintenance during the first year
    - In later years, tech is integrated into the fixed cost base → core product heavily reliant on IT

1. **Sales** 
    - Months 1-3: **€200-€400/month** more in person sale efforts for the starting seasons
    - After - steadily **€100/month** since we don´t sell a physical product and the app is free to use (put focus on marketing and HR)

1. **HR / Team Structure**
    
    Sponti begins with a small, 2 person team:
    
    - **Months 1–6:**
        - 1 founder (full-time) (Marketing Admin ⇒ €2,500 per month)
        - 1 part-time student assistant (16,50€ per hour; 20 hours per week ⇒ €1,320 per month)
        - Personnel cost equivalent: **~€3,820/month**
    - **Month 7 onward:**
        - Adding 1 IT Working student for further Software development  (16€ - 18€ hourly wage; 20 hours per week)
        - Personnel cost increases by €1,360 ⇒ **€5,180/month**

1. **General Costs**
    - **€200/month** for tools, insurance, and legal services
    - relatively low since the product is “only” an app

### **9.3.3 Cost Forecast**

**Year 1**

**Fixed Costs** 

- HR total €52.640
- General Costs total €2.400
- Production total €1.200

⇒ **€56.240**

**Variable Costs** 

- Marketing total €10.450
- Sales total €1.900
- Discounts - disregarded for now since our business strategy already relies on discounts it wouldn´t be a huge incentive to give out more

⇒ **€12.350** 

**Year 2:**

**Fixed Costs**

- HR total €62.160
- General Costs total €2.400
- Production total €1.200

**Year 3:**

The Cost Estimation of Year 3 heavily relies on how fast we scale and whether or not we will need office spaces

**Fixed Costs**

Assumptions:

- Small team expansion (from ~1.5–2 FTE → ~3 FTE)
- Still **no large office**, mostly remote
- Slightly higher tech + admin needs

**HR (Team of ~3)**

- average monthly HR cost: **€6.800**
- €6.800 × 12 = **€81.600**

**Production (Tech)**

- Increased server + maintenance
- €150 × 12 = **€1.800**

**General Costs**

- More tools, accounting, legal
- €300 × 12 = **€3.600**

⇒ **€87.000**

**Variable Costs**

Assumptions:

- Stronger growth phase
- Higher marketing intensity
- Same lean sales setup

**Marketing**

- average €1.100/month
- €1.100 × 12 = **€13.200**

**Sales**

- Still lean: €150/month
- €150 × 12 = **€1.800**

**Discounts**

- Tactical only
- **€2.000/year**

⇒ **€17.000**

| **Year 2** | €87.780 | **€77.000** | **+€11.270** |
| **Year 3** | ~€130.000 | **~€144.000** | **+€40.000** |

**Break-even** Achieved by March of **Year 2**, driven by growing student usage and strong restaurant on-boarding.
