**9.1.4 Customer Relationship**

**Restaurant Owner** 

**1. Assisted onboarding during early phase**

- We personally support restaurants in setting up their profile, time slots, and first off-peak incentives
- Ensures a smooth start and reduces the initial learning barrier for owners and staff

**2. Self-service management dashboard with AI support**

- After onboarding, restaurants can independently manage deals, availability, and adjustments through a self-service dashboard
- An optional AI-supported feature helps restaurants create simple off-peak deals by formulating simple off-peak deals, particularly by suggesting clear and appealing wording for offers
- This reduces operational effort while maintaining flexibility and control for restaurant owners

**3. Monthly performance summaries**

- Restaurants regularly receive data-driven insights (e.g., off-peak fill rates, new guest visits)
- These insights help owners evaluate the effectiveness of their offers and adjust time slots or incentives accordingly

**Students**

**1. Push notifications for time-specific deals**

- Users receive real-time offers such as early-bird discounts or low-crowd alerts
- Keeps the audience engaged and supports spontaneous dining decisions

**2. Smooth and fast mobile experience**

**9.1.5 Revenue Streams**

**Commission-Based Revenue Model (Restaurants)**

The platform generates revenue exclusively through a commission-based model on the restaurant side. Both restaurants and students can use the app free of charge, with no subscription or listing fees. This lowers the entry barrier for partners and supports rapid adoption.

In contrast to subscription-based models used by competitors such as Neotaste, where users pay upfront every month regardless of usage, Local Table removes all financial barriers on the demand side. This is especially important for our price-sensitive student customers, for whom subscription fees can reduce adoption and engagement.

By shifting the revenue stream entirely to the restaurant side and linking revenue to realized visits, the model ensures strong incentive alignment between our platform and its partners: both benefit only when off-peak demand is successfully generated.

The commission is charged per completed customer visit and is tracked via a QR code scanned at the restaurant. Based on insights from two interviews with restaurant owners, a commission rate of 7% was identified as realistic and acceptable

**Revenue Calculation per Guest:**

- Average spending per guest: **€20**
- Average time-based discount offered by restaurants (assumed 20%): **–€5**
- Net revenue for restaurant before commission: **€15**
- Our Platform commission (7% of €20): **€1.12 per guest**

This means that for every guest visiting a restaurant through the platform, the company earns approximately €1.12 in commission revenue. The model ensures strong incentive alignment, as revenue is only generated when restaurants successfully attract additional guests during off-peak hours

**2. The Founding Team**
We plan to establish a **UG (haftungsbeschränkt)** as our legal form. We chose this structure because it requires low start-up capital, limits personal liability, and is well-suited for an early-stage digital venture

- **Lead Founder (Full-time)**
    
    One founder is responsible for the day-to-day operations and works full-time on the venture. Key responsibilities include:
    
    - Acquiring and communicating with restaurant partners
    - Onboarding restaurants and setting up initial deals
    - Testing and validating offers
    - Managing early-stage marketing activities
    - Handling customer and partner support

    While the founding team consists of four founders, operational responsibility is concentrated with one full-time founder. The remaining founders contribute on an as-needed basis, providing strategic input and operational support without initial compensation.
    
- **Student Assistant (Part-time)**
    
    In addition, one part-time student assistant supports operational tasks, particularly in onboarding, data maintenance, and basic marketing activities.
    



**3. First Restaurant Partners**

    (e.g., Glockenbach, Maxvorstadt)

- 1–2 contacts at local universities
- A few student ambassadors or friends spreading the word
- Small local groups (expats, foodies, students)

**9.1.9 Cost Structure**

**Marketing & Growth**

Marketing and growth costs mainly focus on building and maintaining a price-sensitive student user base. These expenses include social media advertising, performance-based campaigns, and content creation, as well as more community-driven efforts such as campus ambassadors, collaborations with universities and student organizations, and presence at local events. Over time, this category also includes experimentation costs, as different acquisition channels are tested and refined to identify the most effective approaches.

**Sales & Onboarding**

Sales and onboarding costs are driven by the acquisition of restaurant partners and the effort required to integrate them smoothly into the platform. This includes founder-led outreach, relationship building, and hands-on onboarding support. In addition, physical materials such as QR codes, table cards, and in-restaurant signage generate production and distribution costs. Time invested in explaining the concept to restaurant owners and supporting early usage is also part of this cost block.

**Product & Tech**

Product and technology costs cover everything required to build, run, and continuously improve the app. This includes initial development, ongoing feature updates, bug fixes, and improvements based on user and restaurant feedback. Furthermore, costs for cloud hosting, backend infrastructure, analytics tools, and general system maintenance are necessary to ensure stable performance and scalability.

**Team & Operations**

This category includes compensation for the founding team and working students who support sales, marketing, and operational tasks. It also covers day-to-day operational expenses related to coordinating the platform, managing partnerships, handling support requests, and keeping daily business activities running smoothly.

**General & Administration**

General and administrative costs consist of essential overhead expenses required to operate the business professionally. These include software subscriptions for communication, project management, and accounting, as well as insurance, legal and tax advisory services, and other administrative obligations.
