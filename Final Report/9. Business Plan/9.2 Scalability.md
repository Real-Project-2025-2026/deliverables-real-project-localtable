9.2 Scalability

Sponti is designed as a locally validated but scalable platform, allowing growth across both geographic markets and restaurant segments.

**Geographic scalability**

After validating the concept in Munich, Sponti can expand to other student-heavy cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, and Cologne. These cities share comparable characteristics, including a dense student population and a high number of independent restaurants facing uneven demand throughout the day.

Market entry can follow a repeatable approach by focusing on areas near universities and using established acquisition channels on both the restaurant and student side.

**Scalability on the restaurant side**

In the initial phase, Sponti focuses primarily on all-day restaurants. These businesses are particularly suitable early adopters, as continuous opening hours increase the likelihood of off-peak periods and unused capacity.

As the platform scales, the addressed restaurant segment can gradually expand to include other independent restaurants that experience demand fluctuations, even if they do not operate continuously throughout the day. This includes, for example, restaurants with weak midweek demand or structurally low utilization during specific time slots.

In later stages, Sponti could also be relevant for restaurants under economic pressure, for which incremental demand during off-peak hours can have a disproportionately positive impact on profitability. This step-by-step expansion allows the platform to grow without changing its core value proposition.

**Demand-side scalability and user growth**

To grow the consumer base, Sponti first focuses on students, as they are the most responsive to discounts and flexible dining times. 

Once the concept is established, the platform can gradually open up to non-student users, such as young professionals or people with flexible schedules. This expansion does not change the core idea of Sponti, which is to fill off-peak restaurant capacity through time-based deals.

By growing the user base step by step, Sponti can stay focused in the early phase while creating additional growth potential in the long term.

**Technological scalability**

The platform is built as a digital product, enabling technical scaling with low marginal costs. Once established, additional restaurants and users can be onboarded without significant increases in development effort.
