Sponti operates at the intersection of local gastronomy and student consumer behavior. The following risks have been identified along with concrete mitigation strategies.

**##1. Restaurant Adoption Risk**

**Risk:**

Local, independent restaurants may be hesitant to adopt a new digital platform due to limited digital maturity, fear of discounts hurting margins, or lack of time to onboard.

**Mitigation Measures:**

- Focus on **off-peak demand optimization**, not permanent discounting
- Simple onboarding with **no fixed costs and pay-per-transaction model**
- Direct, in-person sales in Munich’s university districts
- Early success stories and local reference restaurants

---

**##2. Student User Adoption Risk**

**Risk:**

Students may not download or regularly use the app if perceived value is unclear or alternatives exist.

**Mitigation Measures:**

- Clear value proposition: **spontaneous, affordable meals near campus**
- Campus-based marketing (student ambassadors, flyers, partnerships)
- Gamification (limited-time offers, exclusivity, urgency)
- Focus on **high-frequency use cases** (lunch, early dinner)

---

**##3. Two-Sided Marketplace Imbalance**

**Risk:**

Insufficient supply (restaurants) or demand (students) could reduce platform value.

**Mitigation Measures:**

- City-by-city rollout (starting with Munich only)
- Supply-first approach in dense student areas
- Manual matching and curated offers during early phase
- Close monitoring of demand/supply KPIs

---

**##4. Revenue & Pricing Risk**

**Risk:**

Transaction-based pricing may not generate sufficient revenue at low scale.

**Mitigation Measures:**

- Gradual increase in **price per transaction** as value is proven
- Optional premium features for restaurants (analytics, visibility boosts)
- Future revenue streams (subscriptions, partnerships)

---

**##5. Competitive Risk**

**Risk:**

Existing platforms (delivery apps, discount platforms) may replicate similar features.

**Mitigation Measures:**

- Strong local focus on **Munich-only, independent restaurants**
- Differentiation through **spontaneity and off-peak capacity management**
- Deep integration into student life and campus culture
- Building local brand loyalty before geographic expansion

---

**##6. Operational & Execution Risk**

**Risk:**

Limited team capacity may slow onboarding, support, or product development.

**Mitigation Measures:**

- Lean team structure with outsourced tech development
- Clear prioritization of core features
- Gradual hiring aligned with revenue milestones
- Use of automation tools where possible

---

**##7. Regulatory & Legal Risk**

**Risk:**

Changes in consumer protection, pricing transparency, or data protection laws.

**Mitigation Measures:**

- GDPR-compliant data handling from day one
- Transparent pricing and offer communication
- Early legal review of terms, discounts, and contracts

---

**##8. Financial & Liquidity Risk**

**Risk:**

Negative EBITDA during early years could strain cash reserves.

**Mitigation Measures:**

- Conservative cost structure and no office in early phase
- Clear runway planning and burn-rate monitoring
- Milestone-based fundraising strategy
- Ability to scale marketing spend up or down quickly
