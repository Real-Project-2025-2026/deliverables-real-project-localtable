The Market Size estimation is split into pre and post Mid Term, since we adapted once we received our Mid Term Feedback. It is based mostly on Data Scraping Websites, Estimations using AI Tools, Google Maps Data (Manually reviewed) and our own Interview findings, since there are no direct Sources which perfectly fit our specific Research Questions.

### 5.4.1 Restaurant Side - Mid Term

**Definitions**

- **TAM (Total Addressable Market):**
    
    The total revenue opportunity available if *every independent restaurant* in the target region (Germany) used our service
    
- **SAM (Serviceable Available Market):**
    
    The portion of TAM we can serve; so independent restaurants in Munich that fit our model (located in urban areas preferably close to campus, digitally accessible, etc.)
    
- **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):**
    
    The realistic short-term share of SAM we can capture (first 2–3 years), based on traction and resources
    

**Step-by-Step Estimation**

**A. TAM - Restaurants in Germany**

- ~163,000 restaurants in Germany
- ~62% are **independent/local** → ≈ **100,000 independent restaurants (no direct data proving this!)**
- *Assumption*: restaurant would pay us ~ €1.000 per year

So **TAM (Germany total)** ≈

> 100.000 × €1.000 = €100 million → our total revenue potential if all independent restaurants in Germany would buy our app
> 

**B. SAM - Munich Focus**

- Munich has ~1.200 restaurants
- about 70% of that are independent restaurants

→ 940 potential Sponti partners in Munich

Assuming our revenue per restaurant (subscription + commission) = ~€1,000 per year (conservative early-stage estimate)

So, **SAM (Munich)** ≈

> 940× €1,000 = €940 thousand annual revenue potential assuming every independent restaurant in munich would participate
> 

**C. SOM - Achievable Share (Years 1-3)**

**Scenario A (30% adoption)**

- we capture 282 restaurants
- → €282.000 annual revenue

**Scenario B (60% adoption)**

→ Based on our interview results so far

**Assumption:**

- Serviceable restaurants in Munich: **≈ 940** independent, table-service restaurants
- Market penetration scenario: **60% adoption (60% said they would definitely use the app)**

**Calculation:**

**60% of 940 restaurants = 564 restaurants**

SOM = 564 restaurants in Munich

(under a high-adoption scenario of 60%)

**Expected Revenue:** 

**564 × €1,000 per restaurant = €564.000 annual revenue**

### 5.4.2 Restaurant Side - Updated Version (Final Presentation)

→ Based on the feedback we received during our midterm presentation, I decided to update the Market size by only including Restaurants that are open the whole day, or specifically Restaurants that don´t close in the afternoon.

I also applied our new revenue model. Instead of the previous assumption, that a restaurant pays us a yearly fee to be displayed on the app, I calculate with a commission per booking via app.

**Definitions**

- **TAM (Total Addressable Market):**
    
    The total revenue opportunity available if every independent restaurant that is open all day in Germany used *Sponti*
    
- **SAM (Serviceable Available Market):**
    
    The portion of TAM we can serve; so independent restaurants in **Munich** that are open all day 
    
- **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):**
    
    The realistic short-term share of SAM we can capture (first 2–3 years)
    

Step-by-Step Estimation:

**New Assumptions**

- A restaurant pays us a **7% Commission** per booking (Discussed briefly with two restaurant owners during our Interviews)
- And expect that the average amount spent on a Restaurant visit in Munich is 20€ per Person
- With an average discount of 20% that leaves the guests with 16€
- And gives us a commission per booking of **1,12€**

**A. TAM - Restaurants in Germany open all day long**

- ~100.000 independent restaurants in Germany (same source as previous TAM)
- estimation: 15% are open all day (Same process as later seen in SAM, for a conservative but safe estimation of potential restaurant partners in Germany)

15% of 100.000 = **15.000 Restaurants**

**Calculation**:

- if all of TAM (Users/Students in Germany) would visit all TAM (Restaurants) once per month
- 2.900.000 (reachable demand side) and 15.000 (reachable supply side)
- 2.9 million restaurant visits per month
- 2.9 mio x 1,12€ = 3.248.000**€ of monthly revenue**
    
    ⇒ x 12 **~39.000.000€ of annual revenue** 
    

**B. SAM - Restaurants in Munich open all day long**

- Munich has ~1.200 restaurants
- about 70% of that are independent restaurants
    
    → 940 independent restaurants
    

Out of these about **30% are open all day →** since there are no direct sources citing exact numbers, we estimated this by manually reviewing the google maps data of one munich quarter and applying the found information Citywide 

**Calculations:**

30% of 940 = 282

⇒ 282 potential *Sponti* partners in Munich

**Revenue:** SAM(Students in Munich) go once a month 

150.000 x 1,12€ = 168.000€ per month

⇒ x 12 ~ **2.016.000€ of annual revenue**

**C. SOM - Achievable Share (Years 1-3)**

We expect a faster adaption rate of restaurants, since we plan to acquire them directly and personally.

**Year 1:**

7% to 35% of Restaurants open all day (282)

7% of 282 = 20 

35% of 282 = 98.7

⇒ In Year 1 we expect to onboard up to 99 Restaurants 

In the Years 2-3 we expect to grow steadily and make our market presence known through direct contact to our target Restaurant group, which is why until the end of Year 3 a total acquisition of SAM should be realistic. (as someone who worked in partner acquisition during my internship I base this estimation on my own experiences)

**Calculation Revenue Year 1 -** See 9.3.1 P&L Calculation

⇒ it is important to note, that every restaurant regardless of opening hours, can experience off peak  hours. Which is why I believe this Market Size estimation to be very conservative. We offer great benefits for any independent restaurant that faces under occupation to any time, in a very time flexible way. (see also 12.2 Next Steps)

### 5.4.3 Consumer Side

→ Analyzing the Consumer Market / App Users was not specifically needed since our revenue derives from the supply / restaurant owner side (seeing as the app is free to use)

but finding the market size of our App Users was useful for us internally, specifically in order to better calculate and develop a financial plan 

**A. TAM - Students in Germany**

→ 2.9 Million Students in Germany

**B. SAM - Students in Munich**

→ 150.000 Students in Munich

**C. SOM - Achievable Share (Years 1-3)**

→ Starting with a 0.2 - 2% gradual Adaption rate for the first years 

~**300 - 3.000** **Students** within Year 1

⇒ Expect an increase up to 15% of SAM until Year 3 

~**22.500 Students** at the ****end of Year 3
