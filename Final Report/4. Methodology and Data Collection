## 4.1 Development of Interview Guide for Problem Identification - (Lara)

To identify the core problem for the Local Table concept, we developed two separate interview guides: one for restaurant operators and one for potentional diners. This distinction was necesarry because both groups experience the off-peak situation from different perspectives and face different challenges and decision criteria

- **Interview objectives**
    - The goal of the restaurant interviews was to understand whether off-peak hours represent a relevant problem for restaurant owners. The interview guide focused on identifying pain points related to low table occupancy and existing ways of dealing with slow periods.
    - The diner interviews aimed to explore eating-out behaviour, price sensivity and flexibility in meal timing. In particular, the interviews examined whether different customer segments would be willing to adjust their dining times in exchange for discounts.
- **Questionnaire design**
Both interviw guides were designed as semi-structured questions. This allows the interviews to follow a clear structure while still leaving room for open discussion. Most questions were open-ended, enabling the respondents to explain their experience in their own words and allowing the collection of both qualitative insights and simple quantitative indeications.
- **Target group and sample**
The restaurant interviews were conducted with indepent restaurants with different sizes in Munich. The diner interviews targeted particiants from different age groups within the same geographic area (Munich). → Following the identification of students as the most responsive segment, we focued our further on analysis on this group. Students showed the highest price sensivity and stronger willingness to adjust their dining times in exchange for discounts. This made them suitable for addressing off-peak capacity issues on the demand side.
- **Implementation**
The interviews were conducted over a defined period using in-person and phone formats, depending on availability. In total we conducted 42 interviews (11 restaurant interviews and 29 potentional diners)
