Problem statement: Many independent restaurants in Munich operate all day but struggle with low occupancy and lost revenue during off-peak hours. At the same time, students are highly price-sensitive and flexible in their dining times, yet lack real-time information and incentives to eat outside peak hours. This mismatch leads to empty tables for restaurants and missed affordable dining opportunities for students

Solution summary: An app based Solution to better occupancy rates in restaurants during off peak hours. Using dynamic pricing and customer benefits in order to bring clients in when the restaurant would usually stay empty. This will result in more revenue for restaurant owners and better time management and utilization of staff. On the user side, it brings consumer benefits in the form of reduced prices and good dining offers.

Key findings: Based on our interviews with restaurant owners and students, off-peak hours represent a recurring operational and revenue challenge for restaurants that are open all-day, while students are a flexible but insufficiently targeted customer segment that responds positively to real-time, price-based dining incentives

Recommendations: Develop a simple digital platform that enables restaurants to offer time-based discounts during non-peak hours, directly addressing the needs identified in the interviews to increase table utilization and incremental revenue
