This project explored how unused restaurant capacity during off-peak hours could be addressed through time-based discounts. The analysis showed that many restaurants struggle with low demand at certain times, while students are generally willing to adjust their dining habits when attractive discounts are offered.
A key insight was that applying dynamic pricing to restaurants is still uncommon, even though it is successfully used in many other industries. This creates an opportunity to introduce a new and more flexible way for restaurants to manage off-peak periods.
At the same time, the project highlighted several challenges. Building a two-sided platform requires constant coordination between restaurants and diners, and access to restaurant owners proved to be difficult and time-consuming.
Overall, the concept shows potential, but further real-world testing and close collaboration with restaurant partners are needed. The project also underlined that developing an entrepreneurial idea is a learning process that depends not only on the idea itself, but on adaptability, teamwork, coordination and the ability to work through challenges.
