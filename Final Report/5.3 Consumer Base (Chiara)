### 5.3.1 Consumer base midterm

**1. Students & Young Locals**

- university students / 18 - 30 year olds
- Estimated biggest group, mainly because of availability, budgeting needs and technological affinity → students are the most time flexible group and probably most willing to try new restaurants / new apps (slightly biased → also most interviewed group)

Needs: Budget-conscious, socially active, always looking for new places to try

Wants: Affordable dining deals, discovering local gems, and spontaneous meetups

**2. Urban Professionals**

- young professionals living or working in Munich, working a corporate job, etc
- Busy schedules, often make last-minute dining decisions
- Convenience and spontaneous after-work dining without long waits

**3. Tourists & City Visitors**

- Tourists and visitors exploring Munich
- Limited time in the city, prefer local authentic experiences over chains, budget traveling
- Easy access to open tables and avoiding tourist traps
- not done enough interviews with tourists to fully comprehend their needs and expectations

**4. Others**  

- could find us through recommendations
- target groups we haven´t specifically interviewed yet

### 5.3.2 Consumer base post midterm

After the midterm presentation we took the feedback we received and decided to update our consumer base. As a Start-Up it´s important to narrow it down and directly target a small and specific Consumer Group.

→ Focus on University Students (HM, LMU and TUM) that live in Munich ~18-27 year olds

Why we chose this consumer group:

- most time flexible
- have budgeting needs
- high technological affinity
- we understand their needs and expectations the best → App by students for students
