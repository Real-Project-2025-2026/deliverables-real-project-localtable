### Strengths of the concept

One of the main strengths of the concept is that **this idea does not yet exist in this form for restaurants**. While dynamic pricing is already widely used in other industries such as travel, mobility, or hotels, it is still uncommon in independent restaurants. Applying this principle to restaurants offers the potential to use existing capacity more efficiently and improve revenues during slow hours.

Another strength is the flexible nature of the concept. Restaurants are not forced into permanent discounts but can decide when and how to offer time-based deals. This makes the approach more controlled and less risky for businesses.

Overall, the concept introduces a new way for restaurants to actively manage off-peak hours without changing their core operations or pricing structure.

### Weaknesses of this concept

A central weakness of the concept is its nature as a two-sided market. The platform only creates value if both restaurants and diners are active at the same time, which makes development significantly more complex. At every step, decisions cannot be made only for one side, as they immediately affect the other side. This means that we needed to develop the  business model and everything behind twice: value propositions, acquisition channels, customer relationships, and everything else must work simultaneously for restaurants and for diners. Changes on one side often require adjustments on the other, which increases coordination effort and makes the progress and the concept very time-intensive.

Another important challenge was that the **primary target group consists of restaurant businesses**. Restaurants are often under strong time pressure, which makes it difficult for us to approach for interviews and insights. During the project, **we personally visited 29 restaurants**, and 18 of them declined to participate in interviews or share information. This experience showed us how difficult and time-consuming it can be to access insights on the business side.

### Lessons learned

One of the most important lessons from this project relates to working together as a team. While the group setting brought in different ideas and viewpoints, collaborating on a daily basis turned out to be more challenging than expected.

At the beginning, it took a long time until everyone shared the same understanding of the core problem and the overall direction of the project. This uncertainty made it harder to move forward and slowed down progress, especially in the early stages.

Collaboration was further shaped by very different working habits and time commitments. Some team members preferred to work steadily and start tasks early, while others tended to contribute closer to deadlines. This difference made coordination difficult and, at times, led to an uneven distribution of workload within the team.
