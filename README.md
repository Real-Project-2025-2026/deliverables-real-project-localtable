## 🍽️ Local Table  - Final Documentation  

## 📄 Final Report Overview

Welcome to the final documentation for Sponti by Local Table. This Wiki [Home](https://github.com/Real-Project-2025-2026/deliverables-real-project-localtable/wiki) serves as the comprehensive narrative of our project, detailing the transition from initial problem identification in Munich's gastronomy sector to a validated digital solution.

While this page contains our final analysis and business strategy, our GitHub Repository provides the structured technical foundation, including raw data matrices, research scripts, and development materials.

## Background & Motivation

Restaurants often face a structural imbalance in demand throughout the day. While peak hours are crowded and stressful, large parts of the afternoon or early evening remain underutilized. This leads to empty tables, inefficient use of fixed resources, and pressure on profitability. At the same time, many potential guests are price-sensitive and flexible in their schedules, but lack transparency and incentives to adjust their dining behavior.

Local Table emerged from the question of whether this mismatch could be addressed not by increasing overall demand, but by redistributing existing demand more evenly across the day.

---

## Problem Definition

The central problem addressed in this project is the uneven distribution of restaurant demand.

Restaurants struggle to generate sufficient revenue during off-peak hours while facing operational stress during peak times. Existing digital solutions primarily focus on reservations, visibility, or delivery, but rarely address the underlying issue of demand concentration at specific times.

From the guest perspective, high prices and overcrowded restaurants during peak hours reduce the overall dining experience, even though less busy time slots would be preferable if the right incentives were available.

---

## Project Approach

The project followed a research-driven approach.

Qualitative interviews were conducted with restaurant owners and potential diners in Munich to understand both sides of the market. Based on these interviews, off-peak underutilization was identified as a recurring and relevant pain point. Different demand-side segments were then analyzed with regard to price sensitivity and flexibility in dining times.

The interviews we conducted were the  foundation of the concept. Students emerged as the most responsive demand-side segment due to their high price sensitivity and willingness to adjust dining times in exchange for discounts.

---

## Concept Overview

Local Table is a conceptual digital solution designed to connect underutilized restaurant capacity with flexible diners.

The concept is based on time-specific incentives that encourage guests to visit restaurants during off-peak hours. Rather than relying on permanent discounts or complex pricing models, Local Table focuses on situational offers that benefit both sides.

The platform is intended to complement existing reservation and discovery tools, not replace them, and aims to improve utilization rather than increase overall consumption.

## Task Distribution

The project was structured along clearly defined chapters, with responsibilities assigned based on individual focus areas. At the same time, differences in motivation and available time among team members influenced the depth of engagement across tasks, while overarching decisions and final alignment were coordinated collaboratively.
